# AetherVM
A basic UNIX based VM capable of running Assembly programs simulating the x86 architecture.

## Reference
This VM started with this [tutorial](https://www.jmeiners.com/lc3-vm/) and then I built on top of it to implement more features, it is worth noting this tutorial implemenets the VM in the LC-3 educational architecture, but to make this a tougher challange and to make it more useful I chose the x86 architecture instead.
